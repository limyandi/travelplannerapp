# Riote Travel Planner App

Riote Travel Planner App is Android Mobile Application that helps user plan their trip in an easy way suggests places directly 
for you on what time, which place to go, only by inputting the start date, end date, 
and the accommodation address. Comes with a very interactive User Interface integrated 
with a recently well-regarded framework by Google, MVVM (Live Data and Data Binding). 
Uses Google Maps API, Places API and many more. Ongoing project with a lot of areas of improvements.

To get started, put in the api key for google places api in the retrofit/nearbyplacesservice.java and in the androidmanifest.xml, you can also find this file by searching TODO.
